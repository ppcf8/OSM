Optimization of Mechanical Systems Course @FEUP

The codes in this repository are related to the solution of the exercises proposed in the book "OPTIMIZATION OF MECHANICAL SYSTEM: OPTIMAL DESIGN APPLICATIONS" by Carlos Alberto Conceição António and Gonçalo Maria Perreira das Neves Carneiro.

The codes for the classes were developed in MATLAB and for some of them a short report was requested which is together with the script files.
For each exercise the Python library Scipy was used to confirm the values obtained.
